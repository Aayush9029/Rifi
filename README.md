### So how does this work?

- Python stars a local server *using flask (library)* 
  - Port : 8000 (configurable)
  - ip : Local host ip (eg: 192.168.1.4)
- Listens for Inputs (Play/pause, volume up...)
- Performs the keystrokes in the Laptop that is running flask.



Basically this transforms an Apple Watch to a virtual remote enabling it to controll multimedia.

Uses:

- While Playing a music in laptop (Play/Pause) (Skip) (Volume up/down) 

- While Watching Movie and keyboard/mouse is a bit too far to reach.

- While playing music to skip tracks and since the keystrokes are configurable they can be use to initiate custom shortcuts.

---

To Do:
- Use multimedia buttons instead of keyboard buttons.
